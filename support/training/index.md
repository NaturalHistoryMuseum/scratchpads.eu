# Training

Training is provided as part of the Scratchpads support and outreach programme.
Our one-day courses aim to help current and prospective Scratchpad maintainers
to develop their site building skills and guide them through major features like
the taxon pages, data import and communication tools. Participants will be given
the opportunity to learn best practices and gain a better understanding of what
the Scratchpads can do for them and their research community.

[Please check our upcoming training courses list](/support/training/events)

**Courses are free to attend**<br> There is no course registration fee but
participants are responsible for their own travel and subsistence expenses when
attending a Scratchpad course.<br> Please note that some courses are organised
in association with national or international conferences. Participants might
want to check with conference organisers on available reimbursement schemes.

**Application procedure**<br> Everyone is welcome to register for a Scratchpad
training course. Due to the limited number of places (ca. 10-15 per course)
applicants will be screened based on the following non exhaustive list of
criteria:

* to involve as many institutions represented as possible
* level of familiarity with scratchpads
* level of IT competence (so that the participants have similar levels of
  understanding and can move at similar speed)
* registration at the associated conference or event (if applicable)

Applications by e-mail or any other method other than
[the provided form](/support/training/events) will not be considered.<br> All
applicants will be notified of the outcome of their application within a week
after the closing date.<br> Applicants will be expected to confirm their
attendance to the course within a reasonable time.

**What are the minimum requirements to attend the course?**<br> In order to
achieve optimum training results we expect all applicants to have previous
experience using the internet. There is no need for any specialised knowledge in
order to attend our training courses or use Scratchpads.

**Have an idea for a new training course?**<br> If you have an idea of a venue
for a training course or would like to propose hosting one at your home
institution please fill in and submit the
[Propose a new course](/propose-new-course) form. We will be happy to evaluate
your proposal and discuss it further with you.
