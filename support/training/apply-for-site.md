# Apply for a training site

_Before you apply for a training site please note that:_
If you would like to try out scratchpads you are advised to use our [sandbox site](http://sandbox.scratchpads.org).
If you think you are ready to apply for your own scratchpad and join the community use the appropriate [application form](http://get.scratchpads.org).

Training sites are usually created for the purposes of training courses. However you may want to request a training site in order to do extensive tests before you create your own. In that case please emailt us with the details below.

_Please note that all training sites will be deleted after a period of 2 weeks. If for any reason you need to extend this period please inform us in due time._
