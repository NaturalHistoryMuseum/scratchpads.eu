Ambassadors
===========

Scratchpad Ambassadors are enthusiastic experienced Scratchpads users that support the Scratchpads team, helping to create virtual research environments where communities of researchers can build, share, manage and publish their research data on the Web. Scratchpads are an easy to use, social networking application that will make researchers' and students' working lives happier by facilitating their online research communities.

**We are appointing a select group of Scratchpads Ambassadors all over the world to be our official representatives.**  
If you are a Scratchpad maintainer or user, you are enthusiastic about Scratchpads and you'd like to spread the word about it in your local or wider research community then please feel free to [apply](ambassadors/form) !

Currently we have [26 ambassadors](ambassadors/current) in 18 countries around the world.
