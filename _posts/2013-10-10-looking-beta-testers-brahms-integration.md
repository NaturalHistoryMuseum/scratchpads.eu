BRAHMS (Botanical Research And Herbarium Management System) and Scratchpads have traveled all the way to to bring the two systems close together. As we are in the last phase of the testing before releasing, we are looking for beta testers to test the export functionality of BRAHMS to Scratchpads. 

To participate you will need to actively maintain a BRAHMS database. 

If you are interested please send an email to support@scratchpads.eu until Oct 15 2013.
