Description

The main Scratchpads server (Quartz) was down for six minutes on Saturday morning resulting in an outage of all Scratchpads services. As a consequence our Solr server (i.e. our search and indexing server) was down resulting in a Scratchpads service degradation from 2013-05-04 03:26 until rebooted at about 2013-05-04 14:20 

We apologise for any inconvenience this might have caused. The Natural History Museum ICT is investigating the cause for this.
