After extended testing in order to minimize the volume of expected issues, we are entering the final phase of upgrading all Scratchpads sites still in the old version. The maintainers of these sites (c. 300) have already received an email explaining the process to be followed. For most of the sites the upgrade will be completed in the next few weeks.

Maintainers of the upgraded sites will be able to use in full extent the added functionality of Scratchpads v.2.0 and users will enjoy a more user friendly and intuitive interface.

<strong>Please note that sites already in the new version will not be affected by this upgrade. </strong>
