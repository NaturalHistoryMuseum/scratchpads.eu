We are very pleased to announce the move to new, more powerful servers has been completed successfully.  This means all Scratchpads are now running faster and will have much less downtime. And, at long last, we are again able to accept applications for new Scratchpads sites.  You can <a target="_blank" href="http://get.scratchpads.org/">sign up for a new site here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://scratchpads.eu/about">find out more about Scratchpads here</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="http://sandbox.scratchpads.org/">give them a test drive on our sandbox</a>.  To our existing users, we'd like to again say thank you for your patience and resilience in sticking with the Scratchpads project through the last years of under-resourcing.  It has been a huge effort to get back to this stage, and we hope now the Scratchpads are stable they will again be a worthy repository for your biodiversity data.

Today, on the 1st of December 2018, we start the first of our six-weekly development cycles (read <a target="_blank" href="http://scratchpads.eu/news/2018-11/creating-sustainable-future-scratchpads">more about that here</a>).  At this stage, we will still be prioritising bug fixes and you can view our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/scratchpads2/issues">outstanding issues on Github</a>.  If you have found a bug, please do <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/scratchpads2/issues">raise an issue on Github (Github account required)</a> or, if you are logged into a Scratchpad, you can now raise an issue directly from within your Scratchpad via the issue sidebar without needing a Github account.

Once we have these bugs resolved, we will start thinking about enhancements and new features.  We will adopt a more inclusive development strategy, where members of the Scratchpad community can help direct our priorities.  How this works is being scoped out now, so if you have opinion on how this can best be achieved, please email us at <a href="mailto:scratchpads@nhm.ac.uk">scratchpads@nhm.ac.uk</a>.  There will be more information on this initiative in a future blog post. In the meantime, we hope you enjoy your faster, more stable Scratchpads.


Thank you,
The Scratchpads Team
