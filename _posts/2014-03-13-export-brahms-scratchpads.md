BRAHMS is a flexible database management system for botanical researchers and herbaria. In the latest version (v. 7.4.2) Brahms software is providing users with the option to <strong>export taxonomies, locations, specimens and people into a .csv format which can be directly imported into a Scratchpad site</strong>.

This new functionality enables researchers and research communities, who use BRAHMS as their primary botanical data management system, to <strong>quickly develop a Scratchpad site based on their existing botanical database</strong> making use of the added functionality Scratchpads provide for structuring, curating, linking and publishing biodiversity data.

You can download the latest version of BRAHMS from:
