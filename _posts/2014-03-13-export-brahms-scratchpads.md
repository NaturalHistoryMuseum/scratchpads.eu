BRAHMS is a flexible database management system for botanical researchers and herbaria. In the latest version (v. 7.4.2) Brahms software is providing users with the option to export taxonomies, locations, specimens and people into a .csv format which can be directly imported into a Scratchpad site. 

This new functionality enables researchers and research communities, who use BRAHMS as their primary botanical data management system, to quickly develop a Scratchpad site based on their existing botanical database making use of the added functionality Scratchpads provide for structuring, curating, linking and publishing biodiversity data.

You can download the latest version of BRAHMS from: http://herbaria.plants.ox.ac.uk/bol/brahms/Software
