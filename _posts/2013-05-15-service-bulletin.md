<strong>Description</strong>

A re-indexing process of all sites took place during Thursday and Friday (15-16/05/2013). As a result some users in certain sites experienced issues accessing their Literature and Media galleries while this is in progress.

We are sorry for the inconvenience that might have caused you. The re-indexing was necessary as a result of a Scratchpads module fix.
