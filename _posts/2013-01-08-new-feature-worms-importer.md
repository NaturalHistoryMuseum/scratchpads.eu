Scratchpads are now using a new importer that allows users to build new classifications based on data from the <strong>World Register of Marine Species</strong> (http://www.marinespecies.org/about.php).
You can find detailed documentation of this new tool in our wiki pages under <a href="http://help.scratchpads.eu/w/Importing_a_WoRMS_classification">Importing a WoRMS classification</a>
