Description

On Saturday evening a power switch feeding key network equipment failed taking external access to the NHM systems. On Sunday during work to fix this, all virtual servers shut down for a brief period affecting many ICT services. ICT have been working to ensure all services are back  and operating normally. We apologise for this loss of service and are investigating what caused the initial loss of power and then the unexpected subsequent loss of further services while we were remedying the problem.
