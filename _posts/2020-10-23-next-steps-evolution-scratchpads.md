This week at the TDWG 2020 conference we presented our intention to migrate Scratchpads away from its current Drupal codebase and towards a system that's easier to support. Part of this involves an exploration of data storage platforms that we can partner with so that our developers can focus more on the user interface.

We've created a <a href="https://github.com/naturalhistorymuseum/scratchpads-redevelopment">git repository</a> to document this process.

We're still very early on in the processs and we're very interested to hear feedback from our users and work with you to find the best solution. You can share your thoughts and contribute to discussions in the repository's <a href="https://github.com/naturalhistorymuseum/scratchpads-redevelopment/issues">issue queue</a>.
