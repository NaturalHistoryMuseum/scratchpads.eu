It is with great sadness that we have to announce the passing of <a href="http://scratchpads.eu/ambassador/bryan-simon">Bryan Kenneth Simon</a> following a short battle with leukaemia.
Bryan was a well known grass taxonomist, having worked at the Queensland Herbarium for nearly four decades and for nine years as a botanist in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia).
Bryan was a Scratchpads ambassador, and vocal supporter of the Scratchpads since their early days. He was very encouraging of what we, the Scratchpads Team, are working towards, making our task that little bit easier. His Scratchpads are amongst the most viewed and used of all the Scratchpads, being an invaluable resource for grass taxonomists. His two Scratchpads (<a href="http://ausgrass2.myspecies.info/">AusGrass2</a> and <a href="http://grassworld.myspecies.info/">GrassWorld</a>) are currently being partially maintained by former colleagues, although if you would like to provide help and expertise, please do get in touch, and we can forward on your offer of help.
Bryan is survived by a wonderful family, including his wife, five children, and several grandchildren.
