Description

On Tuesday 20 August between 18:00 and 23:00 (GMT+1), The Natural History Museum ICT will be performing vital upgrades to the Museumâ€™s IT infrastructure. This work will require a period of network downtime. As a result Scratchpads will not be available during this time. This includes all subdomains of myspecies.info, e-monocot.org and scratchpads.eu domains.

The upgrade will enable ICT to provide better resilience to core IT hardware and improve the reliability and availability of hosted services.

We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. 

This bulletin will close when the service is again fully functional
