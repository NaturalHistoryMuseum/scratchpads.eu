<strong>We are pleased to announce that Scratchpads 2.0 is formally leaving beta!</strong>

Since the first Scratchpads 2.0 release in 2012 we have completed over 800 reported issues and added many improvements and new features.

Today marks our second update of Scratchpads 2.0 as we change from "rolling releases" to versioned bi-weekly releases.

There are a number of benefits you should see from the switch to versioned releases: we can more easily let you know about updates and improvements; do more thorough testing; and maintain our documentation more easily.
