title: "New server: One step closer to failover"

Scratchpads hosted at the Natural History Museum, London, are, as of today, being served by two servers (Silica and Quartz) instead of the previous one (Quartz).  This should result in faster page load times, especially at peak times.  The current configuration will allow Silica to be taken offline for maintenance, with all sites being served by Quartz.  It will not allow for Quartz to be taken offline, something we intend to work on in the future.

Scratchpads may experience some transient issues as we finish setting up the new server.
