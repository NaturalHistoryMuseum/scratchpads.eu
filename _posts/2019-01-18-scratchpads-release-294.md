    - <a href="https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/scratchpads2/issues/5643">More comprehensive .gitignore for sites directory (@edwbaker)</a>

Additionally, the few sites that were archived have been made visible again so that they can be statically browsed at their original URLs.

We would again like to apologise for any inconvenience caused during the Christmas period when all sites experienced performance issues.

In the next 6-week sprint we will again be tackling more bugs with the aim of closing all the currently open bugs in the issue queue (https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/scratchpads2/issues). We are also planning on redeveloping the maps module.

Thank you,
The Scratchpads Team
