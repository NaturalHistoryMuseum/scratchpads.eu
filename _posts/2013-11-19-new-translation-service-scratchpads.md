We have dropped the Google Translate Toolkit as a facilitator in translating Scratchpads interface and set-up a new more user friendly and intuitive system.

The new service is very similar to the Drupal Localize server. It should be used by translators from around the world to maintain localizations of the Scratchpads.

Just pick your language and you'll be able to download existing work and contribute to the translations. You can find more information on http://localize.scratchpads.eu

Once again, thanks to all of you who are actively helping us translate Scratchpads in your language!
