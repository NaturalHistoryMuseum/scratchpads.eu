In collaboration with Kew Gardens you can now directly import your georeferenced specimens to GeoCAT .

GeoCAT is designed to produce rapid species level conservation assessments based on IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2001). Through an easy to use interface with a familiar Google Map underlay, you can upload primary occurrence data for a species and at the click of a button, calculate values relating to the geographic range of a species.
