In collaboration with Kew Gardens you can now directly import your georeferenced specimens to <a hre="http://www.kew.org/science-research-data/kew-in-depth/gis/species-conservation/geocat/index.htm">GeoCAT </a>.

GeoCAT is designed to produce rapid species level conservation assessments based on IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2001). Through an easy to use interface with a familiar Google Map underlay, you can upload primary occurrence data for a species and at the click of a button, calculate values relating to the geographic range of a species.
