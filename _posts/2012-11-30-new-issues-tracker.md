excerpt: "We have a new issues tracker!"
---

We have a <a href="http://support.scratchpads.eu/">new issues tracker</a> which is part of our new project management system that now runs on <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a>.

All Scratchpad users can continue to post issues from their Scratchpads in the same way as before by clicking on the issues tab on the left hand side of the site when logged in.

The majority of issues submitted by users will be found under the <a href="http://support.scratchpads.eu/projects/spad2_support/issues">Support Project of Scratchpads 2</a> in the new system.

We are currently sorting and categorising all of the issues from our old system.
