The Scratchpads 2.9.8 release is a maintenance release, fixing a few minor bugs and upgrading Drupal from 7.63 to 7.67.

We have also added the new documentation source files - used to build https://scratchpads.readthedocs.io - to the main Scratchpad repository. This will help ensure our help and support files do not become out of sync from our main code base.
