In addition to the currently selected languages we would also like Scratchpads to start speaking Chinese. If you would like to contribute towards this translation please contact us at support@scratchpads.eu. 

Scratchpads are already being used by research communities and individuals around the world. To facilitate wider use of Scratchpads we are commencing a project to translate the Scratchpads interface to multiple languages. This project will be primarily crowd-sourced to our extended user community, as they have the expertise to accurately translate used terms in their respective language.

As we are relying in your contribution to achieve this goal, if you are interested in contributing to the translation of scratchpads to any of the following languages, please send us an e-mail titled "Translation contribution" to support@scratchpads.eu. You may find more information on the Scratchpads Translation Project in our wiki page at http://help.scratchpads.eu/w/Translating_scratchpad
