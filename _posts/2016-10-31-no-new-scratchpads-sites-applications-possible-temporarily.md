We are sorry to announce that for reasons related to our current technical and support capacity we will not be able to temporarily accept applications for creating new Scratchpads sites. This does not affect the operation of the current Scratchpads sites, or registration of new users to existing sites.

We will update you once this issue has been resolved.

For more information on this issue, please email your query to scratchpads@nhm.ac.uk
