# Data management

**Scratchpads data management**

**1 Types of supported data**<br> Scratchpads by default are able to support a
wide variety of data structures including, but not limited to:

* Bibliographies;
* Character projects (morphological; morphometric and molecular characters);
* Country maps;
* Custom content types;
* Custom Forms;
* Fora (with e-mail integration);
* Images;
* Image Galleries;
* Taxon Pages (based on the Species Profile Model fields);
* Taxonomies;
* Point Localities (based on the relevant Darwin Core Fields);
* Newsletters;
* Basic Pages;
* Phylogenies;
* Polls;
* Specimen Records (based on the relevant Darwin Core Fields);
* Publications in Pensoft journals Note that some of these content types are
  available only to Scratchpads2. These content types will be extended as time
  and opportunity permit.

**2 Data and metadata standards**<br> Scratchpads by default support the
following data standards, in which they are able to import and export data:<br>

* BibTeX, RIS, XML bibliographic citations (export can also be in XML, RTF or
  Tagged Field);
* CSV / XLSX (spreadsheet content);
* Darwin Core Archive and selected Extensions;
* EXIF, XMP image metadata;
* ITIS taxon metadata standard (for taxon names and hierarchies);
* LUCID (for taxonomic keys);
* Nexus (character data, export only);
* Species Profile Model (for taxon Descriptions);
* Structured Descriptive Data (for taxonomic keys, export only);
* XML (export only, selected content in the TaxPub schema)
  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK47081/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK47081/)).
  Note that some of these standards are available only to Scratchpads2. These
  formats will be extended as time and opportunity permit.

**3 Policies for access and sharing and provisions for appropriate
protection/privacy**<br> Access and sharing privileges are controlled on a page
by page basis by each Site's Maintainer. There are four pre-specified user roles
that control actions through a cascading hierarchy of permissions, from
Maintainer, Editor, Contributor to Anonymous User. Contributors are restricted
to authoring and editing their own content, editors can author and edit any
content, while maintainers also have certain administrative privileges. A
click-through agreement ensures that each user agrees to a set of terms and
conditions that outline their rights and responsibilities in use of the site.
Each site can modify the standard Terms and Conditions as necessary, although
Maintainers should note that access to personal information about individuals
using the sites is covered by the UK Data Protection Act 1998 that outlines the
Scratchpads administration team's legal obligations to protect that
information.<br> Scratchpads project administrators can gain full administrative
control to any Site from a hidden account should it be necessary for maintenance
purposes. We undertake that such access is done with the knowledge of the Site
Maintainer.

**4 Data storage, management, and backup**<br> Data are stored across a series
of Virtual Machines owned and operated by the Natural History Museum (NHM). The
Scratchpads servers are backed up using IBMâ€™s Tivoli Storage Manager that
archives the last seven versions of any file contained within the system. These
archives are stored on tape, and are periodically collected and stored off site,
outside London. Site maintainers can request a backup of their database and site
content that could be used to re-establish the Site on another server or extract
and re-purpose the data. The version control system built into to the Drupal
Content Management System provides full version control for content created
within a site.

**5 Plans for archiving and preservation of access**<br> A mirror server run by
the bioinformatics group at the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum
Berlin-Dahlem provides a synchronous copy of the Scratchpads servers. This group
(part of the ViBRANT consortium) have signed a written agreement to archive,
maintain and sustain access to this mirror service until 2016. The Scratchpads
have been incorporated into the NHM's digital strategy and as such are now
supported by tenured staff. Whilst not guaranteeing future enhancement of the
Scratchpads, it does guarantee access to the Sites for the foreseeable future.

**6 How long will Scratchpads last?**<br> The Scratchpads program was initially
developed as part of the European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy (EDIT,
[http://www.e-taxonomy.eu/index.php](http://www.e-taxonomy.eu/index.php)), an
FP6 Network of Excellence programme. It was extended by major funding through
the EU FP7 research infrastructures programme (ViBRANT,
[http://vbrant.eu/](http://vbrant.eu/)) and UK research council funding
(e-Monocot, [http://e-monocot.org/](http://e-monocot.org/)) through to December
2013\. Scratchpads have seen logarithmic growth in both the number of sites and
the number of registered, active users since their inception in 2007
([http://scratchpads.eu/explore](http://scratchpads.eu/explore)). The Scratchpad
code is open source
([http://scratchpads.eu/develop/repository](http://scratchpads.eu/develop/repository))
and is being installed by various people around the world. While significant
extension of Scratchpad functionality will require further grant funding, active
development by other groups or individuals is already starting to appear. While
we cannot guarantee that Scratchpads will exist in perpetuity the project and
the data entered into Scratchpads are secure and accessible for the foreseeable
future.

**7 To what extent does Scratchpads record and respect licenses?**<br> Users are
encouraged to use one of the Creative Commons licences, preferably CC-BY, as
described in the terms and conditions of use. Some content can be protected
under an alternative licence, in mixed-mode presentation. Licences can be
controlled on individual entities (i.e different on each item of content) and
the provenance of all content is automatically recorded by the system. We are
working toward a more granular system of attribution where metrics on the
authors and up-loaders of content can be summarised and displayed. Some versions
of the Scratchpads 2.0 sites (specifically the eMonocot Scratchpads profile)
provide field level attribution so that multiple sources and different licences
can be used for each field within a single page (node). Field-level attribution
and licensing is also supported within the Darwin-Core Archive exports of these
datafiles. All licences are machine readable to facilitate content sharing.
