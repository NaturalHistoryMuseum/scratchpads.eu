Create your own site
====================

![](/about/why/why-create.png)

**Create your own website to connect, work with and share your data. Build a virtual community based on a your specific or wider research field**  
  

Signing up for a Scratchpad is free, quick and simple! No knowledge of website creation is required and your site can cover any aspect of natural history (a taxonomic group, a geographical area, club or society, journal, etc).

## Overview of features: - Master

### Your own look

With scratchpad you manage your own site - so the look of it is unique.

### Your own features

With your own site, you can select the specific set of features that matter to your work.

### Use Character Matrices

Create and manage character matrices. Use character projects to describe taxa or specimens based on morphological, molecular, chemical or any other quantitative or state characters you wish.

###  Upload Media

Upload and annotate media files (i.e. images, videos, sounds), link them to taxonomic terms and provide rich metadata.

### Manage Taxon Descriptions

Create descriptions of organisms. You can include a diagnostic description as well as conservational, evolutionary, ecological and geographical data.

### Manage Specimen records

Manage your specimens and/or observation records, link them to taxonomic terms and curate them online.

### Manage Localities

Create your own point or polygon based localities using the inbuilt google maps interface or by using geographical coordinates. Use localities for associating specimens or observations.

### Manage a Bibliography

Use Scratchpads to manage your references, link them to taxonomic terms and export them in several standardised formats (e.g. BibTex or XML).

### Create Pages

Create your own static pages you wish and link them to taxonomic terms. Use them to provide more data on specific taxa or subjects or just as an 'about us' page.

### Create Maps

Put specimens and observations on maps. Use maps to set extents of geographical distributions and occurences.

### Build Taxonomies

Create biological or non-biological taxonomies and manage classification trees with your taxa.
