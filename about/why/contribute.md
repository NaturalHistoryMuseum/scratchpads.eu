Contribute to biodiversity knowledge
====================================

![](/about/why/why-contribute.png)

**Link and share your structured data to make it widely accessible.**  
  
Scratchpads provide the neccessary tools to allow you to mobilise and link your biodiversity data. Import and link data from multiple biodiversity resources and allow your data to be re-used with attribution in global biodiversity initiatives like the [Encyclopedia of Life](http://eol.org/) and [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org/). Anyone who uses your data will cite you for your contribution.

## Overview of features: - Master

### Publish in peer reviewed Journals

Submit original data present in your scratchpad directly to peer-reviewed journals for publication.

### Nexus formatting

You can export your character data as a valid Nexus file. Nexus files can be imported to software packages for further analysis (e.g. phylogeny).

### Darwin Core Archives (DwC-A)

We use DwC-A as a metadata standard. This promotes the mobilisation of data between different platforms and biodiversity resources. As an example you can publish your Taxon Descriptions to the Encyclopedia of Life using a DwC-A.
