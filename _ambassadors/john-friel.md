## Research field 

My main area of research is on the biodiversity of freshwater fishes, particularly catfishes (Order Siluriformes) for which am an authority for both African mochokid catfishes and Neotropical aspredinid catfishes

## Professional experience

For the past 12 years I have focused primarily on African freshwater fishes, and have to date conducted about a dozen biodiversity surveys all over Africa (Cameroon, Central African Republic, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Republic of Guinea,Tanzania &amp; Zambia). This has lead to the discovery of several new genera and species of fishes.<br>
I received my PhD in Zoology from Duke University in 1995, and did at postdoc at Florida State University. For the past 14 years I have served as the Curator for Fishes, Amphibians &amp; Reptiles at the Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates.
