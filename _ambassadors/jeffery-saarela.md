## Research field
Taxonomic and phylogenetic studies of pooid grass genera and tribes (e.g., Bromus; Calamagrostis, Trisetum and relatives).<br>
DNA barcoding studies of grasses, sedges and the Canadian Arctic flora.<br>
Higher-order phylogenetic relationships in the commelinid monocots (i.e., Arecales, Commelinales, Poales, Zingiberales, and Dasypogonaceae) based on plastid DNA sequence data.

## Professional experience
Research scientist at the Canadian Museum of Nature.<br>
The goals of my research program are to characterize the biodiversity (taxonomy and systematics) of grasses (Poaceae), sedges (Cyperaceae) and their monocot relatives. I combine work in the field, herbarium and DNA laboratory to characterize morphological and molecular diversity in these plant groups, and to reconstruct their evolutionary history at deep and recent evolutionary levels. I regularly conduct field work across North America, from southern Mexico to the Canadian Arctic.
