## Research field

I’m a technocrat trying to find out smarter ways to get away from the ‘technology world’ for my pursuits in wildlife. I have a keen interest in avian research especially distribution and environmental niche modeling, population dynamics of waders, breeding biology of gulls and terns. My enduring love for natural history was ignited while working on Marine Biology at the Gulf of Kutch. An ornithologist at heart and an aspiring professional wildlife photographer, I found my niche in scientific avian photography.

I am now working for ICT4C (Information and Communication for Conservation) in order to spread awareness about wildlife and biodiversity among amateurs. One of the fundamental issues in the conservation of biodiversity is the non-availability of adequate and reliable information on a single platform, which would help in developing appropriate conservation strategies. My work on IBIS (Indian Biodiversity Information System), a web portal launched by the Foundation for Ecological Security, is a step towards this.

## Professional experience
Since July 2008 Deputy Manager of GIS &amp; Biodiversity Informatics at the Foundation for Ecological Security, Anand.  More than 12 years of experience in Conservation Research &amp; Planning using GIS and Remote Sensing. Received my BE in Computer Engineering from the North Gujarat University, Patan, Gujarat and MSc in Ecology &amp; Environment from the Indian Institute of Ecology and Environment, New Delhi. Plannng for a PhD.

Received the Carl Zeiss Award for Wildlife Conservation 2012 for my contribution on AVIS-IBIS Portals.
