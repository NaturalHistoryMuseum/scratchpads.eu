"Bryan Kenneth Simon","It is with great sadness that we have to announce the passing of Bryan Kenneth Simon following a short battle with leukaemia.
Bryan was a well known grass taxonomist, having worked at the Queensland Herbarium for nearly four decades and for nine years as a botanist in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia).
Bryan was a Scratchpads ambassador, and vocal supporter of the Scratchpads since their early days. He was very encouraging of what we, the Scratchpads Team, are working towards, making our task that little bit easier. His Scratchpads are amongst the most viewed and used of all the Scratchpads, being an invaluable resource for grass taxonomists. His two Scratchpads (AusGrass2 and GrassWorld) are currently being partially maintained by former colleagues, although if you would like to provide help and expertise, please do get in touch, and we can forward on your offer of help.
Bryan is survived by a wonderful family, including his wife, five children, and several grandchildren.

Description
On Tuesday 20 August between 18:00 and 23:00 (GMT+1), The Natural History Museum ICT will be performing vital upgrades to the Museum’s IT infrastructure. This work will require a period of network downtime. As a result Scratchpads will not be available during this time.

The upgrade will enable ICT to provide better resilience to core IT hardware and improve the reliability and availability of hosted services.

"Join the Scratchpads Translation Project for Chinese","In addition to the currently selected languages we would also like Scratchpads to start speaking Chinese. If you would like to contribute towards this translation please contact us at scratchpads@nhm.ac.uk.
Scratchpads are already being used by research communities and individuals around the world. To facilitate wider use of Scratchpads we are commencing a project to translate the Scratchpads interface to multiple languages. This project will be primarily crowd-sourced to our extended user community, as they have the expertise to accurately translate used terms in their respective language.
As we are relying in your contribution to achieve this goal, if you are interested in contributing to the translation of scratchpads to any of the following languages, please send us an e-mail titled ""Translation contribution"" to scratchpads@nhm.ac.uk.
