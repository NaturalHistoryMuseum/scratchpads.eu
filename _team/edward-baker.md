[Ed](http://ebaker.me.uk) is a biologist, bioinformatician, Drupal developer and ex-physicist with an interest in the orthopteroid insects groups, particularly [stick insects](http://phasmid-study-group.org) and [cockroaches](http://blattodea-culture-group.org). He has been using Scratchpads for a number of projects since 2007, and joined the team in 2008 recording how-to screencasts to help our early users through the teething stages of the project. These days Ed is mainly involved in the [eMonocot](http://about.e-monocot.org) project, developing new functionality for the botanical community and to allow users to export their data via DarwinCore Archives. Outside of the Scratchpad project he works for the [International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature](http://iczn.org) and is also involved in a number of citizen science projects (e.g. the [Lyme Regis Digital Live Science Experiment](http://ebaker.me.uk/lymeregis)). He will describe species in exchange for [cheese](http://www.townmillcheese.co.uk/).
