**Scratchpads Coordinator & ViBRANT PI**  
Vince is research scientist at the Natural History Museum London, developing Web-based tools to study biodiversity. His focus is on making taxonomy a Web based science, and plugging this in to the wider network of scholarly communication tools and services. When he is not doing this, he works on the evolution of parasitic lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera). He coordinates the Scratchpad project and the two funding programmes (EU FP7 ViBRANT, and the NHM's component of NERC funded eMonocot project) that provide most of the Scratchpads financial support. He also works with staff at the NHM alongside other institutions and initiatives to ensure that the Scratchpads meet the needs of stakeholders.
